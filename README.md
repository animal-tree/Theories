These are all old summaries. Some have developed much further than what I've described. Still evolving. Documenting here the ones I've written up digitally.

I started documenting [here actually](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2) but was too lazy to change the folder structure. I'm gonna continue documenting there, but now this version exists in case I want to switch folder structures.

Also, my digital Notes have way more theories. This doesn't even touch the surface. I just mean the ones I already committed and felt comfortable enough with at some point.
